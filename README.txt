Two algorithms : K Nearest Neighbours & SVM linear

The data can be founded here : https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Occupancy+Detection+

Simple modification of the data before using it for this algorithm : Delete the first line where there is columns names. 

Info on the dataset : Accurate occupancy detection of an office room from light, temperature, humidity and CO2 measurements using statistical learning models. Luis M. Candanedo, VÃ©ronique Feldheim. Energy and Buildings. Volume 112, 15 January 2016, Pages 28-39.
